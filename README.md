Cross-sectional analyses were performed on one time point for individuals from CO and AZ cohorts. Longitudinal analyses were performed on individuals in CO cohort who provided multiple samples on different days.

Sequence files for the Colorado cohort (longitudinal and the Colorado portion of the cross-sectional) are deposited in QIITA as study ID 13145 to allow for future meta-analyses or other microbiome studies and are in the process of being submitted to EBI.

Sequence files for the Arizona cohort (part of the cross-sectional study and not the longitudinal study) are publicly available from both [Kang et al., 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23844187/) and [Kang et al., 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29274915/).

Software used for the included analyses included R programming, Python and Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME, qiime2.org).
