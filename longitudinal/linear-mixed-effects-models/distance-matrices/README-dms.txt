For distance matrices, when multiple categories were used "qiime diversity beta" was used (with the option for 'euclidean' metric), and when one category was needed, either "qiime metadata distance-matrix". Alternatively, for pairwise calculations, such as for percentage carbohydrates, a simple Euclidean distance (absolute value between the two scores) could be used for each difference between time points.

Final distance matrices are "sparse", in this case, meaning that only distances within each individual matter--not distances between one individual and different individual.
