Linear Mixed Effects (LME) models for each relationship can be run from the corresponding script  in each folder. Each folder contains an R script with the input file containing the data created from either the raw values OR the absolute differences between the values on different days. 

The goal of our project, and especially the included LME analysis was to understand changes within each individual *without* regard to the microbiome results of other individuals in each cohort.
